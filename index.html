        <h1>ðŸŽ² Dice Game</h1>
        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
          The Dice Game is a two-player game where players take turns rolling a
          six-sided dice. The goal is to accumulate 100 points before your
          opponent does. Here's how it works:
        </p>
        <h2>Gameplay:</h2>
        <p>
          Rolling the Dice: On each turn, the active player rolls the dice. If
          the roll is anything other than 1, the player can add the rolled
          number to their current score. The player can continue rolling to
          accumulate more points on their turn, but if they roll a 1, they lose
          all points accumulated during that turn. Holding the Score: If a
          player decides to "hold" (click the Hold button), the points
          accumulated during their turn are added to their total score. Then,
          control switches to the next player. Winning the Game: The first
          player to reach 100 points wins the game. When a player wins, the game
          announces the winner and the "New Game" button becomes active to reset
          everything.
        </p>
